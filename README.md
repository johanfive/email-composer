# email-composer

This is a templating app allowing to store pre-drafted portions of recurring emails,
and then quickly compose an email with a few clicks.


Learned:
React
React-Redux
data normalization + functional programming basics
selectors (+ touched on memoization, need to dig more into it)
Higher order components (to be practiced more)
React-Router
Draft.js (Reading through the API and trying to make sense of it was an incredible learning experience)
Firebase database + auth (still figuring out a better architecture / debating whether to keep redux in combination to Firebase or not)
CSS modules (really interested in this approach and will dive deeper)
